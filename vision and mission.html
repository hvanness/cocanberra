      <div class='content'><strong>The Co-operative&nbsp;Commonwealth</strong>
      <p>“A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landing. And when Humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realisation of Utopias.”
      <br>― Oscar Wilde
      </p>
      <p>The Co-operative Commonwealth is a concept where all the fundamental needs of a group of people are met through a complex of strong communities, active commoning, and a strong network of co-operating, Co-operative businesses dedicated to the common good.
      </p>

      <p>Beginning with the formation of the "Climate Co-ops", we will incrementally build an interlocked system of:&nbsp;
      </p>

      <div class='content'>1. Strong and well connected communities, from the local scale, through the bioregional scale, nationally, and internationally.
      <br>
      <br>2. A politics which is based on sovereignty at the local level, with responsibility for decision making and enforcement taken at the lowest possible level, then delegated to the levels above only if required.&nbsp;
      <br>
      <br>3. A culture of commoning within these communities to provide for as many of our needs as is practical, reducing the need for paid work and introducing a culture of abundance (rather than scarcity).
      <br>
      <br>4. Interlinked cooperative businesses in all sectors. With a common mission to maintain the common good, the co-ops can cater for any tasks which require a dedicated workforce.
      <br>
      <br>5. Regeneration of Earth and human culture.
      <p>
      This regeneration of human culture could be similar to the 
      <a class='contentlinks' target="_blank" href="https://voicesforindi.com/about/the-indi-way/ " rel="external nofollow">Voices for Indi movement
      </a>in the Indi electorate in Victoria, or take inspiration from other stateless democracies like the <a class='contentlinks' target="_blank" href="https://civiroglu.net/the-constitution-of-the-rojava-cantons/" rel="external nofollow">Democratic Federation of Northern Syria</a><span></span>, or any of the myriad experiments in democracy which are available.
      </p>

      <p>The Cooperative Commonwealth is where we want to be at the end of our journey. A place where work does not dominate our lives. Where work serves the needs of people and planet, and money is only a means to that end. A place where everyday life contributes to the flourishing of nature and community. A place where all are treated fairly and equally, and all take responsibility on a daily basis for the upkeep of their society.

      <a class='heading'>The Challenge</a>
      <div class='content'><a><strong>We must reorganise ourselves, and redesign our&nbsp;institutions.</strong></a>
      <p>The Economy is broken, fundamentally. Its workings create horrific inequality and it is on a collision course with its own habitat. We need to create a new economy which is compatible with living processes on our one and only Earth. Now.
      </p>
    </section>

    <div class='content'>1. To meet our needs into the distant future
    <br>
    <br>2. To collectively keep hold of the benefits we have gained through the immense wealth and knowledge given to us by past generations.
    <br>
    <br>3. To distribute this fairly amongst all Humanity.
    <br>
    <br>4. To discard the destructive practices, the wasteful practices, the inequality and the lack of empathy inherent in the current organisational forms.
    <br>
    <br>5. To regenerate the living systems of Earth.
    <br>
    <br>6. To regenerate the cultural systems of humanity.
    <br>
    <br>7. To prioritise the wealth of the community above the wealth of the individual.
    <br>
    <br>8. To maintain a dignified living for people throughout the process and into the future.
    <br>
    <br>9. To create a locally controlled, diverse, interconnected ecosystem of organisations across the world which fulfil the above requirements.
    

      <p>This reorganisation of how we provide for our needs must be designed to be capable of replacing the current system, of shaking off the inappropriate institutions when the time is right.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the Australian political scene is about as disconnected from these realities as it could be, and is actively working to make these problems worse.
      </p>

      <p>Traditional politics will NOT be the way out of this situation (although a different form of politics will be one part of the solution)
      </p>

      <p>The urgency of our task means the time has passed for bickering over which solution is the best one - we need everyone to do everything they can in their own way, and all do it at the same time, and we need to support each other as much as we can while doing it.
      </p>

      <p>We believe the time has come for the thousands of Australians already working towards this new economy and culture to find each other, to support each other, and by finding ways their different passions and projects can work together, to amplify each other.
      </p>

      <p>So how can we take positive steps to address the situation, without asking the government for help, and expecting limited if any support from big business?

      <div class='content'><strong>The Climate&nbsp;Co-ops</strong>
        <p>“We never were separate from nature and never will be, but the dominant culture on earth has long imagined itself to be apart from nature and destined one day to transcend it. We have lived in a mythology of separation.”
        <br>― Charles Eisenstein&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Because the way we collectively spend our money and pay our bills is how the whole show is ultimately funded, and what we collectively do with most of our waking lives - our work - is how it is all achieved, we (the general population who have to work for our money) have two very powerful tools at our disposal.
        </p>

        <p>Currently, the means to meet our needs are organised by people who are fully absorbed in a worldwide competition to hoard the largest amount of other peoples wealth. Obviously, this leaves us without some portion of the wealth we create every day.
        </p>

        <p>By organising to provide for ourselves, and by working in the organisations we create, we deprive these wealth hoarding folks of their access to our wealth, and of their access to workers. We can claim this wealth (which we have produced in the first place) and this work (which we have done, and will continue to do) for ourselves, in our own communities.
        </p>

        <p>We just have to organise it ourselves.
        </p>

        <p>By turning the bills we already pay towards locally owned and run co-operative businesses, we can then decide what these businesses do with the wealth they create. We can create local co-operative systems which are designed to key in with ethics and principles compatible with safe, happy, healthy communities and a thriving Earth.
        </p>

        <p>Through these Climate Co-ops, we can fund the beginning of a new economy, with very little cost to ourselves (we just keep on paying our bills - but now to ourselves). Through them, we can begin a new business culture of working together in non-authoritarian ways towards a collective, community focused form of wealth.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>We will provide ethical and just employment for local people (a Right Livelihood) and an opportunity for people to experience “daily democracy” through their workplace – a learning experience that cannot be unlearned, which will lead to a desire for properly democratic structures in the larger society, and provide some knowledge of how to achieve this.
        </p>

        <p>The Climate Co-ops can provide a short term (20-30 years) investment opportunity for divestors - traditional investors who want their money to support good, creative things.

      <p><strong>So how do we start, on the&nbsp;ground?</strong> Co-operatives, Commons &amp; Communities Canberra (CoCanberra) was formed in late 2016 to begin this journey.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>We are here to provide ongoing support and resources for new and existing organisations who align with our mission of creating Climate Co-ops (to address the immediate climate crisis, and its cultural causes) and through them our vision of a Co-operative Commonwealth, beginning here at home in Canberra and its surrounds.
