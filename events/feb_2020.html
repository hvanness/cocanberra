      <p>February 24th 2020: Regenerative food systems in the Canberra region - part 2
      </p>

      <p>A presentation of the proposals main components, and a last round of feedback.
      </p>

      <p> 
      </p>

      <p>The proposal is designed around the principles of: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Access for all to good, healthy food
        </li><li>Providing a stable, secure living for farmers
        </li><li>Connecting people with the sources of their food - building an inclusive community across cultures
        </li><li>Food sovereignty - Community ownership of food producing land
        </li><li>Localism - Food production and ownership in local ownership and control
        </li><li>Healing the Earth / Care for the land / Regenerative farming
        </li><li>Education - Farming techniques, normalising the need for change, demonstrating feasibility, maintaining interest and engagement, and helping it replicate elsewhere - Reframing farming
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The main components of the design are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Customers and workers will both own the co-op, and will aim to achieve the most beneficial balance of both their interests.
        </li><li>Community Supported Agriculture: <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200321104049/http://www.csanetworkausnz.org/" rel="external nofollow">http://www.csanetworkausnz.org/</a><span></span>
        </li><li>Cote Jardins volunteering system in France: Little info available in English. Their CSA customers must dedicate 4 Sundays each year to volunteering on the farm. This means that nearly every weekend has a big group descend on one job or another with a large workforce. The Sunday afternoon / evening is a meal / party.
        </li><li>Enterprise stacking: Joel Salatins talks <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200321104049/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJc8i5B9RU" rel="external nofollow">"Stacking Fiefdoms"</a><span></span> and  <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200321104049/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8iRRSzLFQg" rel="external nofollow">"Successional Success - Fields of Farmers"</a><span></span> give a good background.
        </li><li>Internal Capital Accounts: <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200321104049/https://institute.coop/resources/internal-capital-accounts" rel="external nofollow">The ICA Group</a><span></span> explains these fairly well - This example unfortunately includes lots of references to the USA's tax laws. It will still give a good idea of what the intent is. 
        </li><li>Holacracy: <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200321104049/https://www.holacracy.org/" rel="external nofollow">Official Holacracy Site</a><span></span> and <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200321104049/https://app.glassfrog.com/organizations/5/orgnav/roles/9970/overview" rel="external nofollow">Actual software example</a><span></span> which provides a clear, well organised way to operate a complicated organisation. Click on the different circles and tabs in the software to explore the actual Holacracy organisation.
        </li><li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200321104049/https://www.one.prepower.com.au/" rel="external nofollow">Pre Power</a><span></span> method of funding for land purchases.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> 
      </p>

      <p>We are also taking a final roud of feedback from the community about what a regional farming co-op could do to help you or your existing enterprise, as a customer, co-ordinator, or workplace (or anything else).
