        <h2>Becoming the Media</h2>

        <p>
        The mainstream media is not showcasing the best of humanity.
        </p>

        <div>In order for:</div>
        <ul>
          <li>good news about well designed projects and enterprises,
          </li><li>related thoughts, ideas and philosophies,
          </li><li>thorough analysis of the causes of our problems
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>to be brought out of the shadows, we will just have to get on and do it ourselves.
        </p>

        <p>Talks at the CoCanberra meetups are recorded, and are posted on <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/behind_the_lines_98_3" rel="external nofollow">the soundcloud site of local Community Radio 2XX 98.3FM's show Behind the Lines. </a><span></span>
        </p>

        <p>Behind the lines works alongside CoCanberra to produce the weekly show, and has recorded 3 national conferences for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.neweconomy.org.au/" rel="external nofollow">New Economy Network of Australia</a><span></span> (NENA), and one Australasian Permaculture Convergence. They are working closely with NENA to start up NENAs Podcast, Align in the Sound.
        </p>

        <p>Volunteers are required to help edit all these recordings - training will be provided if required.</p>

        <p>We also have a website - volunteers are required to develop this from its fairly basic current form into a solutions wiki describing all sorts of fantastic groups and organisations.</p>

        <h2>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.neweconomy.org.au/" rel="external nofollow">New Economy Network of Australia</a><span></span> (NENA) Canberra Region Hub</h2>
        <p>Is now active, working closely with CoCanberra.</p>
        <p>The New Economy Network of Australia (NENA) is a network of individuals and organisations working to transform Australia’s economic system so that achieving ecological health and social justice are the foundational principles and primary objectives of the economic system.</p>
        <p>NENA works to facilitate connections, showcase and promote innovative projects, build peer-to-peer learning and use collective strategies to create and advocate for change, so that we can build a strong movement of people demanding, creating and benefiting from a ‘new’ economy.</p>
        <p>There are three dimensions to NENA’s work: we are building networks, connections and shared initiatives:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>within specific geographic areas such as towns/cities, regions and states. Please read about our <a target="_blank" href='https://www.neweconomy.org.au/nena-hubs/'>Geographic Hubs</a> for more information</li>
          <li>across different sectors within the new economy, including: sustainable food, energy, transport, housing, indigenous economics, ecological economics and many more. Please read about our <a target="_blank" href='https://www.neweconomy.org.au/nena-hubs/'>Sectoral Hubs</a> for more information.</li>
          <li>that prioritise specific strategic goals every year. (Information about NENA’s Annual Strategic Plan will be available soon)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To carry out our work, NENA is made up of a growing number of connected, semi-autonomous Sectoral and Geographic Hubs that bring people together to focus on different issues in the new economy. NENA also has a central coordinating hub that provides support to our Hubs across Australia, and secretariat support to our elected groups.</p>
